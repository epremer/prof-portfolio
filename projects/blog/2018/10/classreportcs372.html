						<div>Below are my experiences in CS 372 at Oregon State University.
						<br><br>
						<h5>Instructor</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">Stephen Redfield</div>
						<h5>Topics</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							<div>
							(REWRITE)The majority of this course focuses on one group project and one personal project paper. For the group project, the course lectures focus on:
							</div>
							<div>
								<ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
									<li>
										Software Engineering Processes
									</li>
									<li>
										Requirements Elicitation
									</li>
									<li>
										Diagram Notations
									</li>
									<li>
										Software Architecture and Decomposition
									</li>
									<li>
										Object Oriented Design
									</li>
									<li>
										Design Patterns
									</li>
									<li>
										Agile Method
									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
						<h5>Preparation</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">(REWRITE)When I learned about the program, I was most excited for this course (as a close second to Analysis of Algoriths) since I'd like to learn to be a software engineer. My preparation for this course actually started back when I started researching Software Development. Nearly every link I found was the Waterfall Method. Of course I had no clue what it all meant at the time since I had absolutely zero experience in the field.</div>
						<h5>Programming Environment</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">(REWRITE)This course doesn't put much emphasis on programming, however I encouraged my group to do our best to actually implement our group project. Implementation was not required, but I felt the project to which we were assigned was well within our abilities given the experiences in previous course.
								<br><br>
								My group wrote a website application using JavaScript, Nodejs, Express, Handlebars, and the usual HTML and CSS. For version control, we used <a href="https://github.com/epremer/CS361_Group25" target="_blank"><b>GitHub</b></a>. For our database, we used phpMyAdmin through OSU. We used node.js on OSU's FLIP server to run the site. My experiences with the project can be found <a href="../../../../projects/cs361_group25.html" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.
								<br><br>
								If you are connected the the Oregon State University VPN, you can view the project as it was submitted (with two week's of work into it; not fully completed, as was expected) <a href="http://flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:2528/login" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>. There are bugs that we would have fixed had we had more weeks to work on the project, but it was expected - required in fact - that we not submit a completed project.
						</div>
						<h5>Assignments</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							(REWRITE)There were minimal assignments, the majority of them group assignments regarding our project, a few reflective journaling assignments, and an individual project.
							<br><br>
							The individual project was a two-parter. The first part was a draft Vision Statment of some software application that would solve a real world problem. This was due early in the class so that the entire class could vote on the best Vision Statements. Once the top were chosen, random groups were assigned to each vision and those authors became our group project Customers. The second part of the individual project consisted of extending the vision statement further, regardless of the path that was taken by the group assigned to that project.
							<br><br>
							My inidividual Vision Statement was called The Recycle Assistant (LINK HERE) and consisted of an Internet of Things device containing multiple internal recycle bins. When a consumer places their recyclable material in the bin, it is scanned, and visibly categorized into a pile with other like items, then the statistics of that recyclable material is reported to the consumer via an LCD screen. The item can be <emphasis>seen</emphasis> joining its like items since the entire device has windows showing the inner piles of recyclables. This - in combination with the LCD statistics readouts - will help reeducate consumers on proper recycling habits. A returned coin or receipt of some kind could also be included in order to incentivize consumers to utilize the device.
							<br><br>
							The group project to which I was assigned was an "Uber for 'X'" outline. Since it was more vague than we were able to realistically complete in a ten week course, my group made the executive decision to develop only a piece of the greater vision. Namely, we focused on the "Uber"-type of aggregate worker web application for a Farm wanting to list and sell produce online, with the aggregate workers being the "Rabbits" who pick up the produce and deliver it to the Customer.
							<br><br>
							The reflections were not difficult for me to complete, since as you can tell I do not mind writing out my thoughts and feelings. Documentation doesn't seem to be difficult for me.
						</div>
						<h5>Exams</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							(REWRITE)Strangely, there was only one exam - the final exam. I will be taking it this Wednesday - it is now Sunday. Without going into specifics, my fellow students have warned that it is incredibly vague, with multiple questions about materials that were not even in the lectures. It is all multiple choice and true/false, so Professor Rooker's popular slogan that "it depends" must also apply to many of the exam questions. I imagine it will be quick and painful.
							<br><br>
							Update: It is now Thursday and I took the final exam yesterday. I feel like I did fairly well, considering I found a set of flashcards online that were very helpful. I agree with my fellow students that the exam questions were not really covered in the lectures, however I disagree that the questions were vague and had "it depends" answers. The way the flashcards I found posed the subject matter, they made a lot of sense. That's not to say I got 100%, by any means, however, I felt well prepared and feel I did well enough.
						</div>
						<h5>Extra Resources</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							(REWRITE)There were no TA office hours for this course, although Professor Rooker mentioned several times that we could ask him for office hours whenever we wanted and he would do his best to comply. I was unable to attend many of the office hours that ended up happening, since they were often held the same day that we were informed of them and I could not reschedule what was already on my calendar.
							<br><br>
							I absolutely used the following resource in studying for the final, although it is basically all the "starred" lecture slides that I had already gone through during my final exam studying earlier this week, but more clearly organized and in one place. It still helped to have written it all out during the lecture slides though. Helped in my understanding, not helped me do better on the exam. ;-p
						</div>
						<h5>Difficulty and Time Commitment</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							(REWRITE)As a group, we made sure to meet once or twice a week for anywhere from one to two hours each meeting, until the topics we wanted/needed to discuss had been sufficiently acknowledged and a plan was made for the next meeting.
							<br><br>
							I would say overall difficulty for this course was low for me. Granted, the more difficult aspects of the group project - actual implementation - were developed by the other members of my group. I more felt like the Project Manager; encouraging the others, organizing the weeks tasks, and making sure the tasks were completed.
