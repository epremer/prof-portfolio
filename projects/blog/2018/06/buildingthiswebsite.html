					<div>
						<div class="blog-spacing"></div>
						<h5>Description</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							This is my experiences putting together this personal website to showcase my abilities.
						</div>
						<h5>The Problem</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							I'm only four quarters and eight courses from graduating from Oregon State University's online post-baccalaureate program with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science! I mean, you know this; you wouldn't be here otherwise. Over the last year and a half of classes, I've wanted to develop my own website from scratch. I wanted to be sure I had the abilities necessary to be a proficient web developer.
							I have since tried to develop one website completely from scratch (for my OSU Web Development course - CS290) which ended up looking so antiquated next to everyone else's websites which were full of site templates, jquery, react, etc. It felt like I'd be cheating if I included those utilities, since I didn't write them myself. I realized there's no point in denying that most of real-world coding consists of using others' work - with their permission of course.
						</div>
						<h5>The Solution</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							I wanted to find an inexpensive - dare I say it, "cheap" or even "free" - template to alter for my own purposes. I did not want the monthly charges of a WordPress or Wix template that I wouldn't even be able to alter. The website can be found <a href="https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page212/run-charity-lite" target="_blank">here</a>.
							<br><br><b>UPDATE: 14 June 2018</b>
							<br><br>After much searching, I came across a service offering free web hosting to students not just for one year, but for their entire undergraduate degree! How cool is that? Now, that translates to almost exactly one year for me, but hey, that's all I really need for now. It's called <a href="https://www.accuwebhosting.com/about/free-students-hosting" target="_blank">AccuWeb Hosting</a>. So far, so good.  :)
						</div>
						<h5>Preparation</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							I did quite a lot of research on what I wanted my website to contain, and wouldn't you know it there were quite a lot of really cool plugins and add-ons that I saw, but they were used in about one out of every four sites, so I thought I'd keep it fairly simple - in terms of what was included. I'm not sure I succeeded in keeping it simple, however I feel like it's something to be proud of given my current level of abilities.
						</div>
						<h5>Any Snags?</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							So far, I'm about 80% finished with the site. I really only need to finish adding some initial blog enties and add my own images.
							<br><br>
							But yes, I've hit a few snags, of course.
							<br><br>
							I have found there is one aspect of CSS that I don't fully understand when it combines external files. When searching the style.css file in this template's assets folder (named public in node, from what I've learned), it doesn't contain everything necessary to completely change all aspects of the website. For example, I'd like to include my own images. But I can't figure out which file/url is providing the automated stock images.
							<br><br>On the one hand, by the time you're reading this, I will have already launched the site, possibly only 90% complete since I've learned it's best practice to "launch at 80%". It's better to provide part of a great service, than no service at all because you spend all your time, budget, energy on perfecting the product 100%. You may <emphasis>never</emphasis> with that approach. On the other hand, I'm still trying to figure it out and haven't actually launched the site today, Sunday, June 10, 2018 at 5:37pm.
							<br><br>
							Another area of difficulty has been the contact form. I'd like the contact form to, well, contact me with the posted input from the visitor. As it stands, there is a .php file that seemingly works on this issue, however I don't know any php yet. I have been scouring the internet for help on actually sending form information, but I couldn't find a solution even in my previous classes. So, I may need to bite the bullet and ask my software engineering friends. Solution pending, but worst case scenario, I comment out the form and only include my contact information rather than the contact form.
							<br><br><br>
							<b>UPDATE: 11 June 2018</b>
							<br><br>
							I've hit another snag in my image carousel for my Cake Creations page. I want to be able to show all four of my awesome cakes and a few images of the process, however, there only seems to be capabilities of showing up to two slideshows.
							<br><br>
							At first, I couldn't even get <i>two</i> slideshows to work concurrently; the arrows on the second container would only apply to the first. I finally found a solution for "multiple" slideshows on a single page, however I find that it only works for two slideshows.
							<br><br>
							I am now working diligently to find a solution. It really helped to go through the code for the individual slideshow and compare it to the differences in the "multiple" slideshow code. I got it to show the first image from the third and fourth sets of images complete with arrows - a task which wasn't posing as easily as W3Schools claims it to be.
							<br><br>
							I will continue to search. Hopefully, I don't have to settle on only showing two of my amazing cakes; I'm so proud of all of them!
							<br><br><br>
							UPDATE: 11 June 2018
							<br><br>
							Woot! I figured it out! It was the "onclick="plusSlides(1, <b>3</b>)" in the previous/next buttons. The third and fourth slideshow would only move the second slideshow because I had copied and pasted from that slideshow's code, meaning I hadn't increased the array of slideshows being "next"d or "previous"d.  :)
							<br><br>
							Well, that feels good to have accomplished. Time for a break, then I'll come back and fix some other issues. The website may be ready to launch soon!

						<h5>Programming Environment</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							I used Atom as my programming IDE for this website.
