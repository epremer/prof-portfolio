						<h5>A Bit O' Background</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							In 2012, I was an undergraduate at University of California, Irvine (<a href="http://www.arts.uci.edu/" target="_blank">ZOT!</a>) studying how to successfully become a (frequently-unemployed) actor. I was in a Business of Show Business class that changed my life.
							<br><br>A ten-week class, the ninth week was focused on "Support Jobs" -- what I call a "Conventional Job" but you might know it as a "Day Job". The idea was to think of some activity or hobby I had that I might only need a bit more training in but that could conceivably sustain me financially while in between acting jobs, as is frequently the case in 90% of all actors in the industry. (Less than 0.5% ever make it to be a "household name".)
							<br><br>Someone mentioned what great massages I give people, and so it started. I moved back home, went to my local massage school, got certified, and fell in love with the bodyworking industry. Not at all volatile or back-stabby like the entertainment industry, I decided to grow my business.
						</div>
						<h5>Change, It is A'Comin'</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							After my mom died and I went through a very traumatic break-up, I decided I needed a change. I knew my body would not be able to sustain massage therapy for 20-30 years. After all, it was supposed to be a "support job", not my full-time gig. So, I sought other areas that might pique my interest.
							<br><br>In 2010, I had also taken an intensive aptitude test developed and proctored by the <a href="https://www.jocrf.org/" target="_blank">Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation</a>. "In a comprehensive battery of tests available only through the Johnson O'Connor Foundation, aptitudes such as manual dexterity, musical ability, spacial visualization, and memory for numbers are measured." Now 2014, I took another look at my test results to see what areas I might have natural aptitudes, in addition to looking at areas of particular interest.
							<br><br>Guess what it told me??
							<br>"You should be an engineer!"
							<br><br>A former-boyfriend, who was a Software Engineer, came to mind. He frequently came home stressed, but I recalled how passionate he was about the field. So, I decided to take an intro class. It. Was. Awful. The course lectures were riddled with typographical errors, and it actually seemed as though the instructor literally used speech-to-text to write out those lectures!
							<br><br>But I loved the material. I wanted more. I started looking for degree programs.
							<br><br>My beautiful <a href="https://www.slocal.com/" target="_blank">Central Coast college town</a> is actually home to one of the more well-known universities for engineering - <a href="https://www.calpoly.edu/" target="_blank">California Polytechnic University, SLO</a>. But they wouldn't take me as an undergraduate student because I already held a degree. o_O So, I continued my search.
							<br><br>I found <a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/online-cs-students" target="_blank">Oregon State University</a> and now it's one and half years later, and it's the most difficult thing I've ever done... but I LOVE IT!
						</div>
						<h5>What Now?</h5>
						<div class="blog-spacing">
							Well, now I'm planning to move up to Corvallis, Oregon to be closer to the Oregon State University campus, maybe join some on-campus clubs, be an active participant in computer science-related activities, the list goes on!
